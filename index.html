        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Wow <span class="name"></span>! you are totally ment for: RUBY</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. 
            If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting
            with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular 
            because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common 
            tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and 
            smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly. Like C# and Java, 
            Ruby is very similar to Python, and Ruby is a great choice at Epicodus if you're interested 
            in Python.

            Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover.
            For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every
            language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#,
            Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and
            Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their 
            marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Wow <span class="name"></span>! you are totally ment for: PYTHON</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Python is one of the most loved programming languages by developers, 
          data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its 
          versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features. Many of the 
          web and mobile applications we enjoy today is because of Python’s abundant
          libraries, various frameworks, vast collections of modules, and file extensions.
          Not only that, Python is great for building micro-project to macro enterprise
          web services as well as on supporting other types of programming languages.

          Although it’s a high-level language and can do complex tasks, Python is easy 
          to learn and has a clean syntax. Therefore, its recommendable for both beginners
          and experienced programmers. Also, there are plenty of ways on how to learn 
          Python; you can do self-study, enroll yourself in coding bootcamp or school 
          or watch online tutorials. The choice is yours to make!</p>

      <h1 class="card-img-top text-center">C#</h1>
      <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Wow <span class="name"></span>! you are totally ment for: C#</h5>
          <p class="card-text">C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for 
          building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time
          and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand 
          languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit 
          of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and 
          surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating
          many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working
          for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice. It's also 
          very similar to Java, so if you're interested in Java development, C# is
          a great choice at Epicodus.
