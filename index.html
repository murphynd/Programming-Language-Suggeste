      <h2> Wow <span class="name"></span> you are totally ment for: RUBY</h2>
        <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. 
          If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting
           with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular 
           because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common 
           tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and 
           smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly. Like C# and Java, 
           Ruby is very similar to Python, and Ruby is a great choice at Epicodus if you're interested 
           in Python.

          Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover.
           For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every
            language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#,
             Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and
              Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their 
              marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing. </p>

      <h2> Wow <span class="name"></span> you are totally ment for: Python</h2>
      <p>Python is one of the most loved programming languages by developers, 
        data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its 
        versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features. Many of the 
        web and mobile applications we enjoy today is because of Python’s abundant
         libraries, various frameworks, vast collections of modules, and file extensions.
          Not only that, Python is great for building micro-project to macro enterprise
           web services as well as on supporting other types of programming languages.

        Although it’s a high-level language and can do complex tasks, Python is easy 
        to learn and has a clean syntax. Therefore, its recommendable for both beginners
         and experienced programmers. Also, there are plenty of ways on how to learn 
         Python; you can do self-study, enroll yourself in coding bootcamp or school 
         or watch online tutorials. The choice is yours to make!</p>

      <h2> Wow <span class="name"></span> you are totally ment for: C# </h2>
      <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for 
        building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time
         and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand 
         languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit 
         of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and 
         surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating
        many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working
        for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice. It's also 
        very similar to Java, so if you're interested in Java development, C# is
        a great choice at Epicodus.</p>
